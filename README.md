# Learning Playground 🚀

This repository documents my journey in learning development tools and practices, specifically focusing on terminal commands, Git, and Python.

### Contents

- **`word_count.py`**: A Python script that counts word frequencies in a text file.
- **`intro_notebook.ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook demonstrating basic usage of NumPy and Matplotlib for data visualization.
- **`dev_cheat_sheet.pdf`**: A generated PDF cheat sheet covering essential terminal, Git, and testing commands. The generation script is `make_cheatsheet.py`.

### Installation and Usage

To run the scripts and notebooks, you'll need Python installed. I recommend using `uv` or `pip` to install the dependencies:

```bash
uv pip install numpy matplotlib jupyterlab fpdf
```

Once installed, you can run the scripts directly or launch Jupyter Lab:

```bash
jupyter lab
```

Enjoy! ✌️
