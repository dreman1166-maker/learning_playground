# learning playground 🚀

yo, this is just me messing around and learning some dev stuff. trying to get better at terminal, git, python, all that good stuff.

### whats in here:
- `word_count.py`: simple script to count words in a file. cause why not.
- `intro_notebook.ipynb`: just playing with jupyter and plotting some numpy arrays. data science vibes 📈
- `dev_cheat_sheet.pdf`: made a python script (`make_cheatsheet.py`) to generate this pdf so i dont forget the basics. has terminal, git, and test commands.

### how to run it:
prob need to install some stuff first. i used uv for this:

```bash
uv pip install numpy matplotlib jupyterlab fpdf
```

then just run the scripts or fire up jupyter lab.

peace ✌️
